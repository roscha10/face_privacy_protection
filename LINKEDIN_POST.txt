Protect facial privacy in public videos with AI-powered detection 🔒

Using YOLOv11-Face and OpenCV, I built a real-time face anonymization system that detects and protects identities in videos, images, and live streams while preserving content context.

Key advantages:
✅ Supports GDPR and privacy regulations compliance
✅ Real-time processing at ~45 FPS on standard hardware
✅ Multiple anonymization methods (blur, pixelation, masking)
✅ Reduces ethical and legal risks in video analytics
✅ Preserves scene context while removing identifiable details

Applications: Social media platforms, surveillance systems, medical imaging, educational content, and dataset anonymization.
